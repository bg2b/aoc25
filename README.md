# Advent of Code 2025

Info and problems are available at https://adventofcode.com/2025

## Overview

Each day's solutions are in a subdirectory, `01`, `02`, etc.

Solutions are C++.  Compile with:
```
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -g -o doit doit.cc
```
There are occasional problems that need something special; in that
case a comment at the start of the file will say what to do.

Example inputs, if any, are called `input1`, `input2`, etc.
The real input, as downloaded from the AOC website, would be called
`input`, though my inputs are not included in the repository.

Input is on stdin, output is printed to stdout.  Run part 1 as `./doit
1 < input` and part 2 as `./doit 2 < input`

Sometimes I might go back and revisit a problem in a different
(usually more efficient) way.  Alternatives will be other `.cc` files
starting with `doit`.

## Recommended problems

Here's my list of recommended problems for the year, along
with direct links.  Recommendations are based on a combination of
factors: perhaps the problem admits an unusual and clever solution, or
perhaps it would allow an interesting visualization, or perhaps the
problem description itself was cute.  In whatever way, I found the
problem unusually fun.  Each of these problems is either ⭐
(recommended) or ⭐⭐ (highly recommended).

+ [Day 2: Gift Shop](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2) ⭐
Brute force works, but it's interesting to do it faster
+ [Day 8: Playground](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8) ⭐
It's kind of obvious what to do, the question is how to do it quickly
+ [Day 9: Movie Theater](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/9) ⭐
This is cute; I may revise to ⭐⭐
+ [Day 10: Factory](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/10) ⭐/⭐⭐
I'm of mixed minds about part 2; it likely requires certain knowledge
to do fast, but perhaps if you're very clever you can manage without.
(I'm not clever enough.)

## Other years

These are my AoC repositories for previous years (all C++, mostly the
same format as this year).  Years that I thought were more fun are
rated with ⭐ or ⭐⭐.
